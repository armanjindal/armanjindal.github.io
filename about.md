# About This Site
*On this page I outline the site's purpose and its metaphilosophy.*

> If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them - **George Orwell** 

This site is where I share my writing, reading, programming, and learning. Below are the primary reasons why. 

First, [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) is meaningful insofar as it can be shared and questioned. The best way to communicate knowledge is clear, concise writing. So, on this site, I strive to write clearly above all else, and I design it to make the reading experience as enjoyable as possible. 

Second, this site is an endless, permanent document of my time spent learning. As a 20-year-old, the *feeling* of time exceeding my age is literally beyond my comprehension. So is the upper limit on what I can learn over the next 25, 40, or 55 years. This site will help me comprehend when I look back. It is one of my answers to [Johnathan Larson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Larson) lyrical, poignant existential question, ["how do you measure, measure a year?"](https://youtu.be/hj7LRuusFqo?t=33). (A question the cast of Rent emphatically responds *"how about looooooove!*"). A way for me to "measure" time is by documenting what I love to learn as I learn it. The promise of compound interest on money doesn't excite me nearly as much as compound interest on knowledge. 

This site is built to last using plain-text markdown pages, converted to a website with the Jekyll framework, hosted on GitHub where I have version control, and backed up regularly on my machine and external storage. I want to track my changing interests and opinions as they develop until I die. I hope you might find what I have put up useful and exciting. 

Lastly, this site allows me to express myself online more authentically than on social media. The medium of social media molds content to fit into an attention market place driven by algorithms that are designed to maximize engagement and encourage distracted, constant use. What I publish on this site is not meant to compete with an bottomless timeline of ads, click-bait, pithy captions, and stunning pictures. As a medium, it limits and changes what I say in ways I do not like and often do not notice. It is bizarre that this is our preferred medium of digital self-expression. Carefully curated social media (or lack thereof) has become a statement about *who we are*. Perhaps a futile and clunky solution, I am building this site from the ground up to express myself more authentically (at least, that is what I tell myself!).

### The Pages
 The *Writing* page is for essays ranging from statistics to psychology to self-experimentation to reflections on learning and the nature of knowledge. I plan to write about everything from the matter that makes up the world to the meaning we find in it, including all the interesting bits in between. I am college student studying both Computer Science and Philosophy, so they shape the perspective I bring.  I am writing for a smart reader but assume no domain knowledge. If I am ever unclear with my use of jargon, please let me know. I aim for clarity above all else. 

 The *Learning* (TBA) page is where I plan to publish open-source notes on college courses I take at school and online. I welcome other collaborators through GitHub. Credit, of course, will be given. The best education material must be made available to everyone. I am privileged to have access to the learning opportunities I do. I want to share them to the best of my ability. 

 The *Reading* (TBA) page is where I summarize, discuss, and criticize important books and articles I read. The first is on Eichmann in Jerusalem by Hannah Arendt (TBA).

### Target Audience 
There are two. In order of priority, the first is my future self. I am writing to remind myself of ideas I thought were important enough to share. What I share is my own opinion formulated to the best of my ability at the time of writing. Since I forget with time, this is my reminder. 

Of course, the other audience is **you**. Whoever you may be. I hope you are an intelligent, kind, open-minded, critical interlocutor.  If we disagree, then my goal is that the source of our disagreement is clear. This means I took a stance distinguishable enough for you to isolate it and critique it. I would appreciate nothing more than an [email](mailto:arman.jindal@columbia.edu) explaining what I've missed, and how you think I can improve. But just because I welcome criticism does not mean I always accept it.

### On Completion 
Completing anything is always a difficult thing. To sidestep this, everything is a draft. I will perpetually be editing. My mind is changing in response to well-argued points, new information and new experience. I will update my beliefs and essays to the best of my ability.  So write to me if you disagree. It is always worth it. 

---
### Miscellaneous 
The links I provide will point as directly as possible to the specific idea. I firmly believe in the honest attribution of ideas. My goal is to steal like a (good) artist, but give credit like a (good) academic. I recognize that I am standing on the shoulders of all those who came before me, and particularly the few I have read. 

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io). To drop comments on writing, you can do so via GitHub or email. 


The icon in the right is for [my Github](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io).  You can find the code for this site and my other projects there too. Potential employer, please reach out for a private link. This is mainly for the code for [(COMS 4118) Operating Systems](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4118/). Normally I do not care much for code produced in coursework, but my experience taking OS was tough and incredible. We spent hundreds of hours hacking the Linux kernel. These included implementing a custom scheduler, a concurrent kernel level key-value store, a custom file system, and more. OS is the toughest class I have taken and it is work I am proud of. However, I cannot put my code in a public repository.  

This site, like my self, is at an early stage of development and rapidly changing.  If you any ideas for improvement in any way, drop me an email!

*A page on what I am doing and with this site, and its metaphilosophy*

> If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them - George Orwell 

This site is where I share my thinking and writing. I want to engage and collaborate with people working on, in the broadest sense, things that matter. Knowledge is meaningful insofar as it can be communicated, shared, and questioned. 

I want to document what I learn as I learn it. As a 20-year-old, I literally cannot comprehend how time exceeding my age *feels*. The upper limit on what I can learn over 20, 25, 30 years is beyond comprehension. I would hope that the knowledge I share might be valuable to someone else. If it isn't, at least I can track my changing interests and positions as they develop. We overestimate what we can do in a day, but underestimate what we can do in a year. The promise of compound interest on money doesn't excite me nearly as much as compound interest on knowledge. 
This site, based in many robust long term technology, is meant to last.

Lastly, I believe that social media has limited authentic digital self-expression. Social media is a way we form a perception about other people and how they perceive us. Our carefully curated social media (or lack thereof) become a statement *who we are*. The constraints of the medium of self-expression end up constraining means of identity.  I want to express myself more authentically. This site, where I have full control, lets me do this. 

The meta-philosophy and design of this site, especially the longterm view on learning, is heavily influenced by [Gwern](www.gwern.net) 

### Content
The *Writing* page of the site includes long-form essays range. From statistics to psychology to self-experimentation to reflections on learning and the nature of knowledge, the content ranges from the matter that makes up the world and the meaning we find in it. I am majoring in both Computer Science and Philosophy, so they tend to seep into my writing.  I am writing to an educated reader but assume no prior domain knowledge. If I am not clear, please let me know. I aim for clarity above all else. 

The *Learning* page (TBA) is about sharing knowledge. I will be open-sourcing notes on college courses I take at Columbia. I welcome other collaborators through GitHub - all contributions are welcome and credit, of course, given. I firmly believe that the best education material must be made available to everyone. I am privileged financially and in my upbringing to have access to the learning opportunities that I do. I value the classes I take, and to the best of my ability, I want to share them. 

The *Reading* (TBA) page includes a summary, discussion and criticism of important books that I read. The first is on Eichmann in Jerusalem by Hannah Arendt.  

Click the icon for my Github.  You can find the code for this site and other projects. 

For a potential employer, please reach out since the majority of the code for my classes, specifically for Advanced Programming and Operating Systems are private at the professor's request. 


### Target Audience 
There are two. In order of priority, the first target audience is my future self. I am writing to remind my future self of the ideas I have thought. What I share is on this site is my own opinion formulated to the best of my ability. Part of this project is seeing *how my views change* and *why*. 

Of course, the other audience is for you. Whoever you may be. Whom I hope to be an intelligent, open-minded, critical interlocutor.  If we disagree, I hope that the source of disagreement is clear. Clear disagreement meant I took a stance distinguishable enough for you to isolate it and critique it. I would appreciate nothing more and feel incredibly complimented if you wrote to me critiquing a piece of writing. I consider an email with feedback as the highest compliment I could ask recieve.  

### Note on Originality
In my writing, there will be many references to authors I have read in the past, quotes, or attributions to other thinkers. 

The links I provide will point as directly as I can find to the specific idea I am referencing. Additionally, I firmly believe in the correct attribution of ideas. To steal like an artist, but give credit like an academic, is the kind of honest exploration I hope to express in this site.  

### On Completion 
Completing an essay is always a difficult thing. So to sidestep this, everything is a draft, and I will perpetually be editing. My mind is changing, and in response to well-argued points, I will update my essays to the best of my ability.  So writing to me at arman.jindal@columbia.edu is always worth it. I will, of course,  give credit and to continually re-write and update my beliefs in light of new evidence is the purpose of this site.

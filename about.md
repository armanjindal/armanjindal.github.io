# Site
*A page on what I am doing with this site, and its metaphilosophy*

> If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them - **George Orwell** 

This site is where I share my writing, reading, programming, and learning. I want to engage and collaborate with people working on things that matter. Knowledge is meaningful insofar as it can be communicated, shared, and questioned. 

As a 20-year-old, I literally cannot comprehend how time exceeding my age *feels*. The upper limit on what one can learn over 20, 25, 30 years is unbounded. I want to document what I learn as I learn it. The promise of compound interest on money doesn't excite me nearly as much as compound interest on knowledge. To track my changing interests and opinions as they develop. I hope in the process, other people might find what I have put up useful or exciting. If you are among this group, I would be thrilled to hear about it.
 
Lastly, social media has limited authentic self-expression. As a medium, it lacks the flexibility a custom-built site offers. Social media narrowly shapes expression to fit the form of endless timeline of click-bait, pithy captions and stunning pictures. Social media has become an essential way we form a perception about other people and the world. Therefore, we are aware, on some level, how our carefully curated social media (or lack thereof) become a statement *who we are*. The constraints of the medium of self-expression end up constraining identity.  I want to express myself more authentically (or at least that is what I tell myself!), so I built [this site](https://armanjindal.github.io/site/). 

The meta-philosophy and design of this site, especially the longterm view on learning, is heavily influenced by [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About).

### The Pages
 *Writing* includes long-form essays range. From statistics to psychology to self-experimentation to reflections on learning and the nature of knowledge, the content ranges from the matter that makes up the world and the meaning we find in it. I am majoring in both Computer Science and Philosophy, so they shape my interest and experience.  I am writing to an educated reader but assume no prior domain knowledge. If I am not clear, please let me know. I aim for clarity above all else. 

 *Learning* (TBA) is about open source collaboration on knowledge. I will be putting up notes on college courses I take at Columbia and online. I welcome other collaborators through GitHub - credit, of course, will be given. The best education material must be made available to everyone. I am privileged financially to have access to the learning opportunities that I do. I value the classes I take, and to the best of my ability, I want to share them. 

 *Reading* (TBA) has a summary, discussion, and criticism of essential books and articles I read. The first is on Eichmann in Jerusalem by Hannah Arendt (TBA).  

The icon in the right is for [my Github].  You can find the code for this site and other projects. For a potential employer, please reach out since the majority of the code for my classes, specifically for Operating Systems, is private at the professor's request. 


### Target Audience 
There are two. In order of priority, the first is my future self. I am writing to remind myslef of ideas I thought were important enough to write about. What I share is on this site is my own opinion formulated to the best of my ability at the time of writing.

Of course, the other audience is for you. Whoever you may be. Whom I hope to be an intelligent, open-minded, critical interlocutor.  If we disagree, then my goal is that the source of disagreement is clear. This means I took a stance distinguishable enough for you to isolate it and critique it. I would appreciate nothing more than an [email](mailto:arman.jindal@columbia.edu) explaining what I've missed.

### On Completion 
Completing anything is always a difficult thing. So to sidestep this, everything is a draft, and I will perpetually be editing. My mind is changing in response to well-argued points and new experiences. I will update my essays to the best of my ability.  So write to me if you disagree. It is always worth it. 

### Miscellaneous 
The links I provide will point as directly as I can find to the specific idea I am referencing I firmly believe in the attribution of ideas. To steal like an artist, but give credit like an academic, is what I strive for with this site. I recognize intellectually I am standing on the shoulders of all those who came before me, and particularly the few I have read. 

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io). To drop comments on writing, you can do so via GitHub or email. 

This site, like my self, is at an early stage of development and rapidly changing.  If you any ideas for improvement in any way, drop me an email!

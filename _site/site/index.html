    <h1 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h1>
<p><em>On this page I outline the site’s purpose, why I am working on it, and its metaphilosophy. More details to come</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them - <strong>George Orwell</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This site is where I share my writing, reading, programming, and learning. Below are the primary (conscious) reasons why.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge">knowledge</a> is meaningful insofar as it can be shared and questioned. The most robust way to communicate knowledge is clear, concise writing. So, on this site, I strive to write clearly above all else, and I design it to make the reading experience as enjoyable as possible.</p>

<p>Second, this site is an endless, permanent document of my time spent learning. As a 20-year-old, the <em>feeling</em> of time exceeding my age is literally beyond my comprehension. So is the upper limit on what I can learn over 25, 40, or 55 years. This site grapple with both questions. It is one of my answers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Larson">Johnathan Larson’s</a> lyrical, poignant existential question, <a href="https://youtu.be/hj7LRuusFqo?t=33">“how do you measure, measure a year?”</a>. (A question the cast of Rent emphatically responds <em>“how about looooooove!</em>”).A way for me to “measure” time is by documenting what I love to learn as I learn it. The promise of compound interest on money doesn’t excite me nearly as much as compound interest on knowledge.</p>

<p>This site is built to last using plain-text markdown, converted to a website with the Jekyll framework, hosted on GitHub where I have version control, and backed up regularly. I want to track my changing interests and opinions as they develop over the next <em>60 years</em>. I hope you might find what I have put up useful and exciting. If you are among this group, I would be thrilled to hear about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, this site allows me to express myself, online, more authentically than on social media. The medium of social media molds content to the norms of an attention market place that uses a bottomless timeline curated by algorithms to maximize engagement. Designed to encourage distracted, constant use, everything I post is competing with an infinite number of ads, click-bait, pithy captions, and stunning pictures. It is bizarre that this is our preferred medium of digital self-expression. Carefully curated social media(or lack thereof) has become a statement about <em>who we are</em>. As a medium, it limits and changes what I say in ways I do not like and often do not notice. Perhaps a futile and clunky solution, I am building this site from the ground up to express myself more authentically (at least, that is what I tell myself!).</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="the-pages">The Pages</h3>
<p>The <em>Writing</em> page is for essays ranging from statistics to psychology to self-experimentation to reflections on learning and the nature of knowledge. I plan to write about everything from the matter that makes up the world, the meaning we find in it and all the interesting bits in between. I am majoring in both Computer Science and Philosophy, so they shape the perspective I bring.  I am writing for a smart reader but assume no domain knowledge. If I am ever unclear with my use of jargon, please let me know. I aim for clarity above all else.</p>

<p>The <em>Learning</em> (TBA) page is where I plan to publish open-source notes on college courses I take at school and online. I welcome other collaborators through GitHub. Credit, of course, will be given. The best education material must be made available to everyone. I am privileged to have access to the learning opportunities I do. I want to share them to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>The <em>Reading</em> (TBA) page is where I summarize, discuss, and criticize important books and articles I read. The first is on Eichmann in Jerusalem by Hannah Arendt (TBA).</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>
<p>There are two. In order of priority, the first is my future self. I am writing to remind myself of ideas I thought were important enough to share. What I share is my own opinion formulated to the best of my ability at the time of writing. Since I forget with time, this is my reminder.</p>

<p>Of course, the other audience is <strong>you</strong>. Whoever you may be. I hope you are an intelligent, kind, open-minded, critical interlocutor.  If we disagree, then my goal is that the source of your disagreement is clear. This means I took a stance distinguishable enough for you to isolate it and critique it. I would appreciate nothing more than an <a href="mailto:arman.jindal@columbia.edu">email</a> explaining what I’ve missed, and how you think I can improve. Just because I welcome feedback does not mean I always act on it.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="on-completion">On Completion</h3>
<p>Completing anything is always a difficult thing. So to sidestep this, everything is a draft, and I will perpetually be editing. My mind is changing in response to well-argued points and new experiences. I will update my essays to the best of my ability.  So write to me if you disagree. It is always worth it.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The links I provide will point as directly as I can find to the specific idea I am referencing I firmly believe in the honest attribution of ideas. My goal is to steal like an artist, but give credit like a (good) academic. I recognize that I am standing on the shoulders of all those who came before me, and particularly the few I have read.</p>

<p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io">here</a>. To drop comments on writing, you can do so via GitHub or email.</p>

<p>The icon in the right is for <a href="https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io">my Github</a>.  You can find the code for this site and other projects there too. For a potential employer, please reach out for a private link. Mainly for <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/4118/">(COMS 4118) Operating Systems</a> Normally I do not care much for code produced for coursework, but my experience taking OS where we did significant Linux kernel hacking that included implementing a custom scheduler, concurrent kernel level key-value store, custom file system, and more, is work I am proud of. However, I cannot put my code in a public repository at the professor’s request.</p>

<p>This site, like my self, is at an early stage of development and rapidly changing.  If you any ideas for improvement in any way, drop me an email!</p>

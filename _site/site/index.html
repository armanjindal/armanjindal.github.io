<p><em>A page on what I am doing with this site, and its metaphilosophy</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If people cannot write well, they cannot think well, and if they cannot think well, others will do their thinking for them - <strong>George Orwell</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This site is where I share my writing, reading, programming, and learning. I want to engage and collaborate with people working on things that matter. Knowledge is meaningful insofar as it can be communicated, shared, and questioned.</p>

<p>As a 20-year-old, I literally cannot comprehend how time exceeding my age <em>feels</em>. The upper limit on what one can learn over 20, 25, 30 years is unbounded. I want to document what I learn as I learn it. The promise of compound interest on money doesn’t excite me nearly as much as compound interest on knowledge. To track my changing interests and opinions as they develop. I hope in the process, other people might find what I have put up useful or exciting. If you are among this group, I would be thrilled to hear about it.</p>

<p>Lastly, social media has limited authentic self-expression. As a medium, it lacks the flexibility a custom-built site offers. Social media narrowly shapes expression to fit the form of endless timeline of click-bait, pithy captions and stunning pictures. Social media has become an essential way we form a perception about other people and the world. Therefore, we are aware, on some level, how our carefully curated social media (or lack thereof) become a statement <em>who we are</em>. The constraints of the medium of self-expression end up constraining identity.  I want to express myself more authentically (or at least that is what I tell myself!), so I built <a href="https://armanjindal.github.io/site/">this site</a>.</p>

<p>The meta-philosophy and design of this site, especially the longterm view on learning, is heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.gwern.net/About">Gwern</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-pages">The Pages</h3>
<p><em>Writing</em> includes long-form essays range. From statistics to psychology to self-experimentation to reflections on learning and the nature of knowledge, the content ranges from the matter that makes up the world and the meaning we find in it. I am majoring in both Computer Science and Philosophy, so they shape my interest and experience.  I am writing to an educated reader but assume no prior domain knowledge. If I am not clear, please let me know. I aim for clarity above all else.</p>

<p><em>Learning</em> (TBA) is about open source collaboration on knowledge. I will be putting up notes on college courses I take at Columbia and online. I welcome other collaborators through GitHub - credit, of course, will be given. The best education material must be made available to everyone. I am privileged financially to have access to the learning opportunities that I do. I value the classes I take, and to the best of my ability, I want to share them.</p>

<p><em>Reading</em> (TBA) has a summary, discussion, and criticism of essential books and articles I read. The first is on Eichmann in Jerusalem by Hannah Arendt (TBA).</p>

<p>The icon in the right is for [my Github].  You can find the code for this site and other projects. For a potential employer, please reach out since the majority of the code for my classes, specifically for Operating Systems, is private at the professor’s request.</p>

<h3 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h3>
<p>There are two. In order of priority, the first is my future self. I am writing to remind myslef of ideas I thought were important enough to write about. What I share is on this site is my own opinion formulated to the best of my ability at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Of course, the other audience is for you. Whoever you may be. Whom I hope to be an intelligent, open-minded, critical interlocutor.  If we disagree, then my goal is that the source of disagreement is clear. This means I took a stance distinguishable enough for you to isolate it and critique it. I would appreciate nothing more than an <a href="mailto:arman.jindal@columbia.edu">email</a> explaining what I’ve missed.</p>

<h3 id="on-completion">On Completion</h3>
<p>Completing anything is always a difficult thing. So to sidestep this, everything is a draft, and I will perpetually be editing. My mind is changing in response to well-argued points and new experiences. I will update my essays to the best of my ability.  So write to me if you disagree. It is always worth it.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The links I provide will point as directly as I can find to the specific idea I am referencing I firmly believe in the attribution of ideas. To steal like an artist, but give credit like an academic, is what I strive for with this site. I recognize intellectually I am standing on the shoulders of all those who came before me, and particularly the few I have read.</p>

<p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/armanjindal/armanjindal.github.io">here</a>. To drop comments on writing, you can do so via GitHub or email.</p>

<p>This site, like my self, is at an early stage of development and rapidly changing.  If you any ideas for improvement in any way, drop me an email!</p>

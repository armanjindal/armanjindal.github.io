<p>The meta-philosophy of this site is heavily influenced by the Gwern at www.gwern.net. His longtermist approach to learning and the target audience he writes for are at the core at my place on the internet. I am also motivated by a number of other factors. I believe that social mediat has limited the medium authentic digital self-expression. I write to recieve feedback, engage and collaborate with other programmers and thinkers about the <strong>things that matter</strong>. Knowledge is sharing and discussing a multitude of ideas. I want to engage in this to the best of my ability using the internet.</p>

<h2 id="content">Content:</h2>
<p>The <em>Main</em> page of the site includes long form essays range from commentaries on current events to hardcore computer science fundementals. From statistics to psychology to self-experimentation to reflections on learning and the nature of knowledge.</p>

<p>I am majoring in both Computer Science and Philosophy so they tend to seep into my writing. There really is no defined purview, but each essay does not assume any prior knowledge. If it does, then links to relevant pages will be posted before. If I am not clear, please let me know. I aim for clarity above all else.</p>

<p>The <em>Notes</em> page is focused on sharing and open-sourcing notes on college courses I take at Columbia and online. I strongly belive that best quality education material must be made available to everyone. I am privalleged financially and in my upbringing to attend the university I do. I value the classes I take, and to the best of my ability I want to share them.</p>

<p>In collaboration with my peers from the class, on Github the content of the course is sharing with links to further content and reading recomended by the proffesor. If we happen to be taking a class together, pl</p>

<p>The (icon) links to my GitHub where the source code for this site is available, along with any and all code I have produced which I can open source. If you are a potential employer looking at my GitHub, please reach out to me since the majority of the code I have produced for my classes Advanced Programming and Operating Systems are in a private repo.</p>

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<p>There are two. In order of priority, the first target audidence is my future self. I am writing to remind my future self of the  ideas I have engaged with, authors I read and things that I learn, and positions I took. What I share is on this site is my own opinion formulated to the best of my ability. Part of this project is seeing <em>how my views change</em> and <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, the second audience is for you. Whoever you may be. An intelligent, open-minded, interloctor.  If we disagree, I hope at least, your disagreement is clear. Clear disagreement meant I took a stance and wrote and thought clearly. I would appreciate nothing more and feel incredibly complimented if you, after reading something I wrote, took the time to engage with it critically.</p>

<h2 id="note-on-originality">Note on Originality</h2>
<p>In my writing there will be a number of references to authors I have read in the past, quotes, or attributions to other thinkers. In conversation I have often done this and been leveled with the charge that I am name dropping to sound like a know it all. This is (almost!) never my intention.</p>

<p>The links I provide will point as directly as I can find to the specific idea I am referencing. Additionally I think it is important to attribute ideas to where they come from and how they influenced the development of my own thought. To steal like an artists, but give credit like an academic is the kind of honest exploration and development of ideas I want to take part in. It is what I strive for on this site.</p>

<h1 id="bias-and-epistemological-beliefs">Bias and Epistemological Beliefs</h1>
<p>I am aware that with my privalleged upbringing and education, there comes with it a set of blindnesses to perspectives and nuances that I miss. Point them out and I will be forever greatful. However, this being said, there is a relativism and nuance which in my two years at college that has been counter productive to any debate.</p>

<p>Here are a few meta-philosophical moves which helped me clairfy confusing.</p>

<p>A paper which has been instructive in putting to rest the knowledge, debate-ending relativism is</p>

<h1 id="on-completion">On Completion</h1>
<p>Completing an essay is always a difficult thing. So to sidestep this, everything is a draft, and I will perpetually be editing. My mind is changing, and in response to well-argued points I will update my essays to the best of my ability.</p>
